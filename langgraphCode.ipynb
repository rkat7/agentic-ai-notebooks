        "# Is LangGraph different from LangChain ?\n",
        "LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for retrieval, LLM calls and tools calls. The classes from LangChain might be used in LangGraph, but do not HAVE to be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "The packages are different and can be used in isolation, but, in the end, all resources you will find online use both packages hand in hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "## LangGraph is particularly great when you need control over your application's flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "If your application involves a series of steps that need to be orchestrated in a specific way, with decisions being made at each junction point, LangGraph provides the structure you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key scenarios where LangGraph excels include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Multi-step reasoning processes that need explicit control on the flow\n",
        "* Applications requiring persistence of state between steps\n",
        "* Systems that combine deterministic logic with AI capabilities\n",
        "* Workflows that need human-in-the-loop interventions\n",
